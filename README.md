# LeetCode Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to various coding problems from LeetCode in C++, along with comments and  explanations .

# Why I created this repository
I created this repository to keep track of my progress as I solve LeetCode problems, and to have a reference for my solutions in case I need to revisit them in the future. I also wanted to share my solutions with others who may be preparing for technical interviews or simply looking to improve their coding skills.

# Structure of the repository
The repository is organized by various questions according to topics and when i did those questions, with each topic having its own directory :

Contests : contains different answers of the contests i gave , there might be certain contests that i didnt solve completly and didnt have time to check further solutions

LeetCode Daily Challenge : The LeetCode Daily Challenge is a program that provides a new coding challenge every day to help users practice their coding skills and learn new concepts. I try to maintain a daily streak of solving the questions everyday but sometimes the questions are harder than i expect and am not able to solve them.

TopicWise Questions : These Include all the important subtopics of DSA, such as binary tree, graphs,queue and so on.
 for problem #1 "Two Sum" in Python.

Each solution file includes  my solution with commentsin addition.
